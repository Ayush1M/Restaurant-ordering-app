## Technologies I Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## What's the Approach?

- First I displayed the menu data of food items using Javascript and added a button to add items to the cart.
- Second I created a cart to add food items. Using each item ID I generated the food item in the cart with its image, price, name, etc.
- After adding the food items I added the food items along with the tax on the total items and created a payment container to total the price.
- After completing the order a form will appear in which you have to add your name and card details to complete the payment.
